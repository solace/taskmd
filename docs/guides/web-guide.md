#### 3. Graph View

**URL:** `http://localhost:8080/graph`

Interactive hierarchical multigraph built with @xyflow/react and the ELK layout engine.

**Features:**
- ELK-powered layered layout — dependency order top to bottom
- Phase compound regions — tasks with `phase:` appear inside labelled dashed containers
- Scope clusters — isolated tasks with `touches:` are grouped into teal-bordered clusters
- Overlay toggles — **Related** and **Spawned-by** edges can be toggled on/off without re-layout
- Preset system — **Default / Deps only / Related / Provenance / Focus** presets in the header
- Focus mode — click a node or use the Focus preset to see a BFS subgraph at depth 1/2/3
- Hover dimming — hovering a node highlights its neighbourhood and dims all other nodes
- Color-by scope — dropdown to tint nodes by their first `touches` scope
- LOD gating — overlay edges auto-hide below zoom 0.5 to reduce clutter

**Edge types:**
- **Solid gray arrow** — dependency (always visible)
- **Solid indigo diamond** — parent→child composition
- **Dashed purple** — related (overlay, toggle in header)
- **Dotted violet** — spawned-by (overlay, toggle in header)

**Node Colors:**
- 🟡 Yellow — pending
- 🔵 Blue — in-progress
- 🟢 Green — completed
- 🔴 Red — blocked

**Interactions:**
- **Hover** — dims non-adjacent nodes, highlights neighbours
- **Click node in Focus preset** — re-centres focus on that node
- **Pan** — drag to move view
- **Zoom** — mouse wheel or pinch; overlay edges hide below 0.5×
- **Status filters** — toggle statuses in the filter bar to show/hide node groups
- **Search** — find a task by ID or title; matched nodes are highlighted

**Understanding the Graph:**
- **Arrows** — point from dependency to dependent (A → B means B depends on A)
- **Phase regions** — dashed indigo box; all tasks with the same `phase:` value
- **Scope clusters** — dashed teal box; isolated tasks grouped by their first `touches` scope
- **Diamond edges** — parent→child (composition); child sits below parent in the layout
- **Focus mode** — shows only the BFS neighbourhood of the selected task

**Best for:**

## Web Features

### Task Editing

The web UI supports editing tasks directly from the browser.

**Task Detail Edit Form:**
- Click the **Edit** button on any task detail page
- Editable fields: title, status, priority, effort, type, owner, parent, tags, and body (markdown)
- Only changed fields are sent to the server
- Validation errors from the server are displayed inline

**Board Drag-and-Drop:**
- Drag task cards between columns to update the grouping field
- Supported when grouping by: status, priority, effort, or type
- Drag-and-drop is disabled when grouping by group or tag
- Visual feedback: columns highlight when dragging over

Both editing features are disabled when the server runs in `--readonly` mode.

### Static Site Export

Generate a self-contained static site from your tasks:

```bash
# Export to default directory (./taskmd-export)
taskmd web export

# Custom output directory
taskmd web export -o ./public

# For subfolder deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages)
taskmd web export --base-path /demo/
```

The exported site includes all views with pre-rendered data. No backend server required — deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, or any static host.

### Read-Only Mode

Start the server in read-only mode to prevent any modifications:

```bash
taskmd web start --readonly
```

When enabled:
- The task edit form is hidden
- Board drag-and-drop is disabled
- The `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` endpoint returns `403 Forbidden`
- All read operations work normally

### Board Filters

The Board page includes interactive pill-based filters:

- **Status** — pending, in-progress, completed, blocked, cancelled
- **Priority** — critical, high, medium, low
- **Effort** — small, medium, large
- **Type** — feature, bug, chore, docs, test
- **Tags** — autocomplete dropdown with all available tags

Multiple values can be selected per category. The filter row automatically hides the field being used for grouping.

### Graph Search and Highlighting

The Graph page includes a search box for finding tasks in the dependency graph:

- Searches task IDs and titles (case-insensitive, instant results)
- Matched nodes are highlighted with a blue ring; unmatched nodes dim to 40% opacity
- The viewport auto-zooms to fit all matched nodes
- Match count displayed next to the search box

## Live Reload

### How It Works

The server watches task files and sends updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE):

1. You edit a task file in your editor
2. Server detects the file change
3. Server sends event to browser
4. Browser refetches data automatically
5. UI updates without page refresh

### What Triggers Reload

- Creating new `.md` files in tasks directory
- Modifying existing task files
- Deleting task files
- Moving tasks between directories

### Troubleshooting Live Reload

**If updates don't appear:**

1. **Check console** (F12 → Console)
   - Look for SSE connection messages
   - Check for errors

2. **Verify file save**
   - Ensure file is actually saved
   - Some editors use temporary files

3. **Check file location**
   - File must be in watched directory
   - Subdirectories are watched

4. **Refresh manually**
   - Press F5 if needed
   - Should reconnect automatically

5. **Restart server**
   ```bash
   # Stop with Ctrl+C, then restart
   taskmd web start --open
   ```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Navigation

- **Click links** - Navigate between views
- **Browser back/forward** - Navigate history
- **Ctrl+Click** - Open in new tab

### General

- **F5** - Refresh page (rarely needed with live reload)
- **F12** - Open developer tools
- **Ctrl+F** - Find in page

### Future Enhancements

Planned keyboard shortcuts:
- `j/k` - Navigate tasks up/down
- `Enter` - Open task details
- `/` - Focus search
- `Esc` - Clear filters/search
- `g + t` - Go to Tasks view
- `g + b` - Go to Board view
- `g + g` - Go to Graph view
- `g + s` - Go to Stats view

## Tips and Best Practices

### Performance

**Large Projects:**
- Web interface handles 100s of tasks well
- Graph view may be slow with >200 tasks
- Use filtering to reduce displayed tasks
- Consider organizing tasks in subdirectories

**Browser Recommendations:**
- Chrome/Edge - Best performance
- Firefox - Good performance
- Safari - Good performance
- Use modern browser versions

### Workflow Tips

**1. Keep web interface open**
- Background tab stays updated
- Quick reference while coding
- Check progress easily

**2. Use multiple views**
- Tasks for detailed work
- Board for planning
- Graph for architecture
- Stats for reporting

**3. Share with team**
- Run on shared server
- Port forward for remote access
- Use for demos and reviews

**4. Combine with CLI**
- Use CLI for automation
- Use web for exploration
- Best of both worlds

### Organization Tips

**Tags for Grouping:**
```yaml
tags:
  - frontend
  - backend
  - database
  - docs
```

Then use Board view → Group by: tag

**Consistent Naming:**
- Use standard status values
- Use standard priority levels
- Use consistent tag names

**Dependencies:**
- Keep chains short
- Use Graph view to verify
- Break up long chains

## Docker

The taskmd web server is available as a Docker image from GitHub Container Registry. The image includes the web frontend and defaults to running `taskmd web start` on port 8080. Mount your tasks directory to `/tasks` inside the container.

```bash
# Run the web dashboard with your local tasks directory
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/tasks:/tasks ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest

# Custom port
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/tasks:/tasks ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest web start --port 3000

# Read-only mode
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/tasks:/tasks:ro ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest web start --readonly
```

**Docker Compose:**

```yaml
services:
  taskmd:
    image: ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./tasks:/tasks
```

You can also use the Docker image to run any taskmd CLI command, not just the web server. For example: `docker run -v $(pwd)/tasks:/tasks ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest taskmd list`

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

**Error: "Port already in use"**
```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :8080

# Use different port
taskmd web start --port 3000
```

**Error: "Permission denied"**
```bash
# Don't use privileged ports (< 1024)
# Use ports 3000-9999
taskmd web start --port 8080
```

### No Tasks Showing

**Check:**
1. Correct directory: `--task-dir ./tasks`
2. Files have `.md` extension
3. Files have valid YAML frontmatter
4. Browser console for errors (F12)

**Debug:**
```bash
# Validate tasks from CLI
taskmd validate ./tasks

# Check verbose output
taskmd web start --verbose
```

### Live Reload Not Working

**Check browser console:**
1. Press F12
2. Look for SSE connection messages
3. Check for errors

**Try:**
1. Refresh page (F5)
2. Restart server
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try different browser

### Graph Not Rendering

**Graph rendering issues:**
1. Wait a few seconds (large graphs take time)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try a different browser
4. Reduce task count with filters

### Page Loads Slowly

**For large projects:**
1. Use filters to reduce data
2. Organize tasks in subdirectories
3. Archive completed tasks
4. Check network tab (F12) for slow requests

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Port and Access

**Local development:**
```bash
taskmd web start --port 3000 --dev
```

**Remote access:**
```bash
# Start server
taskmd web start --port 8080

# Port forward via SSH
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@remote-host

# Access from local browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Multiple Projects

**Switch directories:**
```bash
# Project 1
taskmd web start --task-dir ~/project1/tasks --port 8081

# Project 2
taskmd web start --task-dir ~/project2/tasks --port 8082
```

**Use tabs** in your browser to manage multiple projects.

### Integration with Development

**Auto-start with project:**

Create a `start-dev.sh` script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start taskmd in background
taskmd web start --task-dir ./tasks &
TASKMD_PID=$!

# Start your app
npm run dev

# Cleanup on exit
trap "kill $TASKMD_PID" EXIT
```

### Export and Sharing

**Generate a static site:**
```bash
# Export full dashboard as static site
taskmd web export -o ./public

# For subfolder deployment
taskmd web export --base-path /demo/
```

**Generate JSON snapshot:**
```bash
# Create JSON snapshot
taskmd snapshot --derived > public/tasks.json

# Share via any web server
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Screenshots for Reports:**
1. Open web interface
2. Navigate to desired view
3. Take screenshot (OS screenshot tool)
4. Include in documentation

## Mobile Access

### Mobile Browsers

The web interface works on mobile browsers:
- Responsive design
- Touch-friendly
- Scrollable views

**Best views for mobile:**
1. **Tasks** - Works well, but table is wide
2. **Board** - Horizontal scroll, good for quick checks
3. **Stats** - Excellent on mobile
4. **Graph** - May be hard to read on small screens

**Tips for mobile:**
- Use landscape mode for tasks view
- Board view works well in portrait
- Stats view is mobile-optimized
- Graph view may need zoom
