# Tutorial: Your First Project

This tutorial walks you through setting up taskmd and managing tasks from scratch. By the end, you'll have a working project with tasks, dependencies, and a web dashboard.

## What is taskmd?

taskmd is a markdown-based task management tool designed for developers and AI coding assistants. Tasks are plain `.md` files with YAML frontmatter that live in your repository alongside your code. You manage them through a CLI, a web dashboard, or directly in your text editor.

**Who is it for?**

- Developers who want task management that lives with their code
- Teams using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf)
- Anyone who prefers plain text over SaaS tools

## Prerequisites

- A terminal (macOS, Linux, or WSL on Windows)
- A text editor
- Go 1.22+ (only if building from source)

## Step 1: Install taskmd

The easiest way is via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap driangle/tap
brew install taskmd
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
taskmd --version
```

```
taskmd version 0.15.0
```

See [Installation](./installation) for other options including pre-built binaries and building from source.

## Step 2: Initialize your project

Navigate to your project directory and run `taskmd init`:

```bash
cd my-project
taskmd init
```

The init command walks you through setup interactively. It creates:

- A `tasks/` directory for your task files
- A `.taskmd.yaml` configuration file
- A `TASKMD_SPEC.md` specification document
- Agent configuration files (if you use Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini)

You can also run it non-interactively:

```bash
taskmd init --task-dir ./tasks --claude
```

After init, your project looks like this:

```
my-project/
├── .taskmd.yaml
├── TASKMD_SPEC.md
├── tasks/
└── ... (your existing files)
```

## Step 3: Create your first task

Use `taskmd add` to create a task:

```bash
taskmd add "Set up project repository" --priority high --effort small --tags setup
```

```
Created task: tasks/001-set-up-project-repository.md
```

This generates a markdown file with proper frontmatter and a slug-based filename. Open it in your editor to add details:

```markdown
---
id: "001"
title: "Set up project repository"
status: pending
priority: high
effort: small
tags:
  - setup
created: 2026-02-20
---

# Set up project repository
```

Add an objective, subtasks, and acceptance criteria:

```markdown
---
id: "001"
title: "Set up project repository"
status: pending
priority: high
effort: small
tags:
  - setup
created: 2026-02-20
---

# Set up project repository

## Objective

Initialize the project repository with basic structure and tooling.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Add .gitignore
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Create README

## Acceptance Criteria

- Repository is initialized with git
- Basic project structure is in place
- README documents how to get started
```

## Step 4: Add more tasks with dependencies

Create a second task that depends on the first:

```bash
taskmd add "Write project documentation" --priority medium --effort medium \
  --tags documentation --depends-on 001
```

```
Created task: tasks/002-write-project-documentation.md
```

And a third task that depends on both:

```bash
taskmd add "Deploy to staging" --priority high --effort small \
  --tags deployment --depends-on 001,002
```

```
Created task: tasks/003-deploy-to-staging.md
```

## Step 5: List and filter tasks

See all your tasks:

```bash
taskmd list
```

```
 ID   Title                          Status    Priority  Effort
 001  Set up project repository      pending   high      small
 002  Write project documentation    pending   medium    medium
 003  Deploy to staging              pending   high      small
```

Filter by priority or status:

```bash
# High-priority tasks only
taskmd list --filter priority=high

# Pending tasks sorted by priority
taskmd list --filter status=pending --sort priority
```

## Step 6: Update task status

Start working on a task:

```bash
taskmd set 001 --status in-progress
```

```
Updated task 001 (Set up project repository):
  status: pending -> in-progress
```

When you're done, mark it as completed:

```bash
taskmd set 001 --done
```

```
Updated task 001 (Set up project repository):
  status: in-progress -> completed
```

You can also update other fields:

```bash
# Change priority
taskmd set 002 --priority high

# Add tags
taskmd set 002 --add-tag api --add-tag backend

# Preview changes without writing
taskmd set 002 --priority critical --dry-run
```

## Step 7: Visualize the dependency graph

See how your tasks relate to each other:

```bash
taskmd graph --format ascii
```

```
[001] Set up project repository (completed)
  └──> [002] Write project documentation (pending)
         └──> [003] Deploy to staging (pending)
  └──> [003] Deploy to staging (pending)
```

Other graph formats are available for different use cases:

```bash
# Mermaid diagram (embed in GitHub READMEs)
taskmd graph --format mermaid

# Graphviz DOT (generate PNG images)
taskmd graph --format dot | dot -Tpng > deps.png

# JSON (for scripting)
taskmd graph --format json
```

## Step 8: Get task recommendations

Ask taskmd what to work on next:

```bash
taskmd next
```

```
 Rank  ID   Title                          Priority  Effort  Score
 1     002  Write project documentation    medium    medium  85
```

taskmd recommends tasks based on:

- **Priority** -- higher priority scores higher
- **Dependencies** -- only tasks with satisfied dependencies are suggested
- **Downstream impact** -- tasks that unblock other work score higher
- **Effort** -- smaller tasks get a boost as quick wins

Filter recommendations:

```bash
# Quick wins only
taskmd next --quick-wins

# Critical path tasks
taskmd next --critical --limit 1

# Filter by tag
taskmd next --filter tag=deployment
```

## Step 9: Validate your tasks

Check all task files for errors:

```bash
taskmd validate
```

```
✓ All tasks valid
Found 3 task(s)
```

Validation catches:

- Missing required fields (id, title)
- Invalid field values
- Duplicate task IDs
- Missing dependency references
- Circular dependencies

Use strict mode for additional warnings:

```bash
taskmd validate --strict
```

## Step 10: Launch the web dashboard

Start the web interface:

```bash
taskmd web start --open
```

This opens a browser with an interactive dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`.

![Tasks view on first launch](/images/web/tasks.view.png)

The dashboard includes several views:

| View | What it shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Tasks** | Sortable, filterable task table with search |
| **Board** | Kanban-style board grouped by status, priority, or effort |
| **Graph** | Interactive dependency graph with search and highlighting |
| **Stats** | Project metrics -- completion rate, priority breakdown, critical path |
| **Next** | AI-powered task recommendations with scores |
| **Tracks** | Parallel work streams based on scope overlap |
| **Validate** | Validation results with errors and warnings |

The web interface updates in real time when you edit task files -- no page refresh needed.

You can also edit tasks directly in the browser by clicking a task and using the edit form.

## Step 11: Use taskmd with AI assistants

taskmd is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. Here's how to set it up with popular tools.

### Claude Code

Install the taskmd plugin for slash command integration:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add driangle/taskmd
claude plugin install taskmd@taskmd-marketplace --scope project
```

Then use slash commands in your Claude Code session:

```
/taskmd:next-task              # Find what to work on
/taskmd:do-task 002            # Start working on task 002
/taskmd:list-tasks             # List all tasks
/taskmd:add-task Fix the bug   # Create a new task
/taskmd:complete-task 002      # Mark task as done
```

### MCP Server (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and others)

taskmd includes a built-in MCP server that works with any tool supporting the Model Context Protocol:

```bash
taskmd mcp
```

Configure it in your tool's MCP settings. For example, in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskmd": {
      "command": "taskmd",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Any AI assistant

Since tasks are plain markdown files, any AI assistant with file access can read and write them directly -- no plugins required. Point the assistant at your `tasks/` directory and it can manage tasks by editing the files.
