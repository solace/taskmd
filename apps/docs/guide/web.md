# Web Interface

Complete guide to using the taskmd web dashboard.

## Getting Started

### Starting the Web Server

```bash
# Basic start
taskmd web start

# Auto-open browser
taskmd web start --open

# Custom port
taskmd web start --port 3000 --open

# Specific tasks directory
taskmd web start --task-dir ./my-tasks --open
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Live Reload

The interface automatically updates when task files change:

1. Edit a task file in your text editor
2. Save the file
3. The web interface updates immediately via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

No page refresh needed.

## Views

### Tasks View

**URL:** `/tasks`

The main task list in a sortable, filterable table.

![Tasks view showing the filterable, sortable task table](/images/web/tasks.view.png)

**Features:**
- **Sortable columns** - click headers to sort (ID, Title, Status, Priority, Effort)
- **Search** - real-time filtering across ID, title, and tags
- **Status filtering** - dropdown to filter by status
- **Clickable tasks** - click ID or title to view full details
- **Dependency counts** - see how many dependencies each task has

Click a task to open its detail page, showing full metadata and rendered markdown body.

### Board View (Kanban)

**URL:** `/board`

Visual board with tasks organized in columns.

![Board view showing tasks organized in Kanban columns by status](/images/web/board.view.png)

**Group by options:**

| Grouping | Columns | Best for |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Status | pending, in-progress, completed, blocked, cancelled | Standard kanban workflow |
| Priority | critical, high, medium, low | Prioritization planning |
| Effort | small, medium, large | Capacity planning |
| Type | feature, bug, chore, docs, test | Work type classification |
| Group | Task groups (cli, web, docs...) | Team-based views |
| Tag | One per unique tag | Feature-based organization |
| Phase | One column per configured phase | Release/milestone planning |

### Graph View

**URL:** `/graph`

Interactive dependency visualization using @xyflow/react (ReactFlow).

![Graph view showing interactive dependency graph with color-coded task nodes](/images/web/graph.view.png)

- Nodes represent tasks, color-coded by status (yellow=pending, blue=in-progress, green=completed, red=blocked)
- **Solid arrows** → hard dependencies (blocking)
- UML-style edge types distinguish relationship kinds:
  - **Solid dark arrow** (→) — hard dependency (UML dependency / blocking)
  - **Solid indigo line with filled diamond** (◆─) — parent/child containment (UML composition; diamond sits at the parent)
  - **Dashed purple line** (─ ─ ─) — related tasks, non-blocking (UML association; no arrowhead, undirected)
  - **Dotted purple open arrow** (···›) — spawned-by provenance (UML dependency; directed child → source)
- Useful for understanding dependencies, finding critical paths, and spotting blockers

### Stats View

**URL:** `/stats`

Project metrics and analytics.

![Stats view showing project metrics, completion rates, and breakdown charts](/images/web/stats.view.png)

- **Overview** - total tasks, completion rate, status breakdown
- **Priority breakdown** - tasks by priority level
- **Effort breakdown** - tasks by effort estimate
- **Dependency analysis** - critical path length, max depth, average dependencies

### Next View

**URL:** `/next`

AI-powered task recommendations showing which tasks to work on next.

![Next view showing recommended tasks with scores and reasoning](/images/web/next.view.png)

- Ranked task cards with priority scores
- Explains why each task is recommended (unblocked dependencies, priority, effort)

### Tracks View

**URL:** `/tracks`

Parallel work tracks showing tasks grouped by scope.

![Tracks view showing parallel work tracks with grouped task cards](/images/web/tracks.view.png)

- Tasks organized into independent work streams
- Helps identify parallelizable work

### Phases View

**URL:** `/phases`

Overview of project phases with progress tracking.

![Phases view showing phase cards with progress bars, task counts, and completion percentages](/images/web/phases.view.png)

- Phase cards showing task counts, completion percentages, and progress bars
- Status badges summarizing pending, in-progress, and completed counts
- Unphased tasks section showing tasks not assigned to any phase
- Defined via the `phases` key in `.taskmd.yaml`

### Feed View

**URL:** `/feed`

Chronological activity feed showing recent task changes from git history and worklogs.

- **Source filter** - show all activity, git commits only, or worklog entries only
- **Time range** - filter by recency (24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or all time)
- **Scope filter** - narrow to a specific task group (e.g. `cli`)
- Entries show timestamp, author, commit message or worklog note, and linked task IDs
- Git entries display per-file changes with field change badges (e.g. status transitions) and subtask completions
- Worklog entries are distinguished with a separate icon

### Validate View

**URL:** `/validate`

Validation results for task files, showing errors and warnings.

![Validate view showing validation results with errors and warnings grouped by file](/images/web/validate.view.png)

- Errors and warnings grouped by file
- Helps catch formatting issues, missing fields, and broken dependencies

### Task Detail View

**URL:** `/tasks/:id`

Full detail page for a single task.

- Rendered markdown body with full task description
- Metadata panel showing status, priority, effort, type, tags, owner, dependencies, related tasks, and spawned-by provenance
- Worklog timeline (if worklogs exist for the task)
- **Edit form** for updating task fields directly in the browser (hidden in read-only mode)

## Web Features

### Multi-Project Support

When you have multiple projects registered (via `taskmd projects register`), the web interface shows a **project selector** in the navigation bar. Selecting a project scopes all views and API requests to that project's tasks. The project list is fetched from the `/api/projects` endpoint.

### Task Editing

The web UI supports editing tasks directly from the browser:

**Task Detail Edit Form:**
- Click the **Edit** button on any task detail page
- Editable fields: title, status, priority, effort, type, owner, parent, tags, and body (markdown)
- Only changed fields are sent to the server
- Validation errors from the server are displayed inline

**Board Drag-and-Drop:**
- Drag task cards between columns to update the grouping field
- Supported when grouping by: status, priority, effort, or type
- Drag-and-drop is disabled when grouping by group or tag
- Visual feedback: columns highlight with a blue ring when dragging over

Both editing features are disabled when the server runs in `--readonly` mode.

### Static Site Export

Generate a self-contained static site from your tasks:

```bash
# Export to default directory (./taskmd-export)
taskmd web export

# Custom output directory
taskmd web export -o ./public

# For subfolder deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages)
taskmd web export --base-path /demo/
```

The exported site includes all views (Tasks, Board, Graph, Stats, etc.) with pre-rendered data. No backend server required — deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, or any static host.

### Read-Only Mode

Start the server in read-only mode to prevent any modifications:

```bash
taskmd web start --readonly
```

When enabled:
- The task edit form is hidden
- Board drag-and-drop is disabled
- The `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` endpoint returns `403 Forbidden`
- All read operations work normally

### Board Filters

The Board page includes interactive pill-based filters for narrowing displayed tasks:

- **Status** — pending, in-progress, completed, blocked, cancelled
- **Priority** — critical, high, medium, low
- **Effort** — small, medium, large
- **Type** — feature, bug, chore, docs, test
- **Tags** — autocomplete dropdown with all available tags

Multiple values can be selected per category. The filter row automatically hides the field being used for grouping (e.g., status filters are hidden when grouping by status).

### Graph Search and Highlighting

The Graph page includes a search box in the top-left corner for finding tasks in the dependency graph:

- Searches task IDs and titles (case-insensitive, instant results)
- **Matched nodes** are highlighted with a blue ring; unmatched nodes dim to 40% opacity
- The viewport auto-zooms to fit all matched nodes
- Match count is displayed next to the search box
- Clearing the search restores the previous viewport

## Common Workflows

### Daily Task Management

1. Open web interface: `taskmd web start --open`
2. Check **Stats** view for project health
3. Switch to **Board** view (Group by: priority) to identify today's priorities
4. Edit task files in your editor - watch the web UI update automatically
5. Review **Board** view at end of day

### Weekly Planning

1. **Stats** view - review progress
2. **Board** view - group by priority
3. **Graph** view - identify dependencies and blockers
4. **Tasks** view - filter by `status=pending` and `priority=high`

### Team Collaboration

- Share screen with the web interface during standups
- Use **Board** view grouped by status for status discussions
- Use **Graph** view to discuss dependencies
- Use **Stats** view for sprint reviews

## Advanced Usage

### Remote Access

```bash
# Start server
taskmd web start --port 8080

# Port forward via SSH
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@remote-host

# Access from local browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Multiple Projects

Run separate instances on different ports:

```bash
taskmd web start --task-dir ~/project1/tasks --port 8081
taskmd web start --task-dir ~/project2/tasks --port 8082
```

### Docker

The taskmd web server is available as a Docker image from GitHub Container Registry. The image includes the web frontend and defaults to running `taskmd web start` on port 8080. Mount your tasks directory to `/tasks` inside the container.

```bash
# Run the web dashboard with your local tasks directory
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/tasks:/tasks ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest

# Custom port
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/tasks:/tasks ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest web start --port 3000

# Read-only mode
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/tasks:/tasks:ro ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest web start --readonly
```

**Docker Compose:**

```yaml
services:
  taskmd:
    image: ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./tasks:/tasks
```

::: tip
You can also use the Docker image to run any taskmd CLI command, not just the web server. For example: `docker run -v $(pwd)/tasks:/tasks ghcr.io/driangle/taskmd:latest taskmd list`
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8080

# Use a different port
taskmd web start --port 3000
```

### No Tasks Showing

1. Verify the correct directory: `--task-dir ./tasks`
2. Ensure files have `.md` extension and valid YAML frontmatter
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Run `taskmd validate ./tasks` from the CLI

### Live Reload Not Working

1. Check browser console (F12) for SSE connection messages
2. Verify file is saved (some editors use temporary files)
3. Try refreshing the page manually
4. Restart the server
