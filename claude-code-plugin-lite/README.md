# taskmd-lite -- CLI-free Claude Code Plugin

A zero-dependency taskmd plugin that uses Claude's native tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep) instead of the taskmd CLI binary. No installation of Go, no compiled binaries -- just plain markdown task management powered by Claude Code's built-in capabilities.

## Prerequisites

None. This plugin requires no CLI binary, no runtime, and no external dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install --marketplace https://github.com/driangle/taskmd
```

Then select `taskmd-lite` from the list of available plugins.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `list-tasks` | List all tasks with optional filtering by status, group, or priority | `/taskmd-lite:list-tasks --status pending` |
| `get-task` | Retrieve a single task by its ID, showing full frontmatter and body | `/taskmd-lite:get-task 042` |
| `get-task-status` | Get just the status of a task by ID | `/taskmd-lite:get-task-status 042` |
| `next-task` | Find the highest-priority pending task with all dependencies met | `/taskmd-lite:next-task` |
| `add-task` | Create a new task file with generated ID and frontmatter | `/taskmd-lite:add-task --title "Add search feature" --priority high` |
| `update-task` | Modify frontmatter fields on an existing task | `/taskmd-lite:update-task 042 --status in-progress` |
| `complete-task` | Mark a task as completed and check off all subtasks | `/taskmd-lite:complete-task 042` |
| `validate-tasks` | Check all task files for schema errors, broken deps, and circular refs | `/taskmd-lite:validate-tasks` |
| `verify-task` | Run a task's verify steps (bash commands, assertions) to confirm completion | `/taskmd-lite:verify-task 042` |
| `do-task` | Pick up the next task and start working on it end-to-end | `/taskmd-lite:do-task` |
| `split-task` | Break a large task into smaller subtasks | `/taskmd-lite:split-task 042` |
| `divide-and-conquer` | Recursively decompose a task tree into actionable units | `/taskmd-lite:divide-and-conquer 042` |
| `import-todos` | Scan source files for TODO/FIXME comments and create tasks from them | `/taskmd-lite:import-todos src/` |

## How It Works

This plugin operates entirely through Claude's native file tools:

1. **Glob** finds task files matching `tasks/**/*.md` patterns
2. **Read** parses YAML frontmatter and markdown body from each file
3. **Edit** and **Write** modify frontmatter fields or create new task files
4. **Grep** searches across task content for filtering and validation

No shell commands are executed. All task operations -- listing, filtering, sorting, dependency resolution, validation -- are performed by Claude directly using file contents.
