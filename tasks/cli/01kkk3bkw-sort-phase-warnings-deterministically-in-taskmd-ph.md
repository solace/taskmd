# Sort phase warnings deterministically in taskmd phases command

## Objective

When running `taskmd phases` and some tasks reference phases not defined in `.taskmd.yaml`, warnings are printed listing those undefined phases. The order of these warnings is currently non-deterministic (likely due to Go map iteration order), causing inconsistent output between runs.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have multiple tasks referencing phases not defined in `.taskmd.yaml` config
2. Run `taskmd phases` multiple times
3. Observe that the order of "undefined phase" warnings changes between runs

## Expected Behavior

Warnings about undefined phases should always appear in a consistent, sorted order (e.g., alphabetical by phase name).

## Actual Behavior

Warning order varies between runs due to non-deterministic map iteration in Go.

## Tasks

- [x] Locate the code in the `phases` command that collects and prints undefined phase warnings
- [x] Sort the warnings (or the phase names) before printing
- [x] Add a test verifying deterministic warning order

## Acceptance Criteria

- Running `taskmd phases` with undefined phases produces warnings in a stable, alphabetically sorted order
- A test confirms the ordering is deterministic
