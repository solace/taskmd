# E2e tests for config loading and precedence

## Objective

Test that `.taskmd.yaml` configuration files are loaded correctly and that the precedence rules (CLI flags > project config > home config) work as expected end-to-end.

## Tasks

- [x] Test project-level `.taskmd.yaml`: create config in task dir, verify it affects command behavior
- [x] Test home-level config: create `.taskmd.yaml` in overridden HOME, verify it's picked up
- [x] Test CLI flag overrides config: set a value in config, override with flag, verify flag wins
- [x] Test default behavior with no config file present
- [x] Test config options that affect output: e.g. `worklogs: false`, default format settings

## Acceptance Criteria

- Project config is loaded and affects command output
- Home config is loaded as fallback when no project config exists
- CLI flags override config values in all tested cases
- Missing config file does not cause errors
