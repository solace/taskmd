# Document all non-documented CLI commands

## Objective

Several CLI commands are registered but missing from the CLI guide (`apps/docs/guide/cli.md`). Add documentation for every undocumented command so the guide is complete. Each command should have a Quick Reference table entry, a dedicated section with description, flags table, and usage examples -- matching the style of existing documented commands.

## Commands to Document

The following commands exist in the codebase but are absent from the CLI guide:

| Command | Source file | Short description |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| `commit-msg` | `commit_msg.go` | Generate a conventional commit message from task metadata |
| `verify` | `verify.go` | Run verification checks for a task |
| `add` | `add.go` | Create a new task |
| `search` | `search.go` | Full-text search across task titles and bodies |
| `context` | `context.go` | Show file context for a task |
| `status` | `status.go` | Get lightweight metadata for a task (no body, no resolved deps) |
| `worklog` | `worklog.go` | View or add worklog entries for a task |
| `import` | `importcmd.go` | Import tasks from external sources |
| `spec` | `spec.go` | Generate the taskmd specification file |
| `mcp` | `mcp.go` | Start MCP server over stdio |
| `man` | `man.go` | Generate man pages |

**Note:** `commit-msg` is covered separately by task 138. The `show` and `update` commands are aliases for `get` and `set` respectively -- mention them as aliases in those sections rather than documenting separately.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add all missing commands to the Quick Reference table
- [ ] Document `verify` -- flags, examples, verify types (bash, assert)
- [ ] Document `add` -- flags, examples for creating tasks interactively or via flags
- [ ] Document `search` -- flags, examples for full-text search
- [ ] Document `context` -- flags, examples for showing file context from `touches`/`context` fields
- [ ] Document `status` -- flags, examples for lightweight task metadata lookup
- [ ] Document `worklog` -- flags, examples for viewing and adding worklog entries
- [ ] Document `import` -- flags, examples for importing from external sources
- [ ] Document `spec` -- flags, examples for generating the specification
- [ ] Document `mcp` -- brief section explaining MCP server usage
- [ ] Document `man` -- brief section explaining man page generation
- [ ] Note `show`/`update` as aliases in the `get`/`set` sections

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every registered command appears in the Quick Reference table
- Each command has a dedicated section with description, flags table, and examples
- Alias commands (`show`, `update`) are mentioned in their parent command sections
- Documentation style is consistent with existing command sections
