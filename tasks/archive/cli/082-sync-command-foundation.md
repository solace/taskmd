# Sync Command Foundation

## Objective

Set up the core `taskmd sync` command with a pluggable source architecture. This lays the groundwork so that individual providers (GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.) can be added independently by implementing a simple interface.

## Tasks

- [X] Design a `Source` interface in `internal/sync/` (e.g. `FetchTasks()`, `Name()`, `ValidateConfig()`)
- [X] Implement a provider registry that discovers and registers available sources
- [X] Define the sync config format (`.taskmd-sync.yaml`) for specifying sources, credentials, project/board IDs, and field mappings
- [X] Implement the `taskmd sync` CLI command that reads config, fetches from the configured source, and writes/updates markdown files
- [X] Handle conflict resolution: detect when a local file was modified and the remote changed too
- [X] Map external fields (status, priority, assignee, labels) to taskmd frontmatter fields via configurable field mappings
- [X] Support `--dry-run` flag to preview what would be created/updated/deleted
- [X] Support `--source` flag to sync a specific source when multiple are configured
- [X] Write tests for the core sync engine and the source interface contract

## Provider Interface (rough sketch)

```go
type Source interface {
    Name() string
    ValidateConfig(cfg map[string]any) error
    FetchTasks(cfg map[string]any) ([]ExternalTask, error)
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- `taskmd sync` command exists and reads `.taskmd-sync.yaml` config
- Adding a new source only requires implementing the `Source` interface and registering it
- `--dry-run` shows a preview without writing files
- Field mapping is configurable per source
- Existing local tasks are updated in place, not duplicated
- Tests cover the sync engine and interface contract
