# Complete Task

Mark a task as completed using the `taskmd` CLI.

## Instructions

The user's query is in `$ARGUMENTS` (a task ID like `077`).

1. **Add a final worklog entry** (if worklogs are enabled):
   - Check `.taskmd.yaml` for `worklogs: false` -- if set, skip this step
   - Otherwise, find the worklog file at `tasks/<group>/.worklogs/<ID>.md` (or `tasks/.worklogs/<ID>.md`)
   - If a worklog exists, append a timestamped completion summary
2. Run `taskmd set $ARGUMENTS --status completed --verify`
   - The `--verify` flag runs any verification checks defined in the task before applying the status change
   - If verification fails, report the failures to the user
3. Confirm the status change to the user
